# Elasticache

Elasticache is a web service that makes it easy to use an in-memory cache in the cloud.
It is a great way to cache frequently access data from a database so users can access it faster from the cache,
thus reducing the load on the database. Especially used on read-heavy databases.

## Supported Cache Engines

1. Memcached -
   1. Object caching system
   2. Used when you are not concerned about redundancy
   3. Used primarily to ease the load on the database
2. Redis -
   1. Key-Value caching system
   2. Supports Master / Slave replication
   3. Supports Multi-AZ access
   4. Supports failover, meaning it is replicated in case the primary case fails
   5. Used especially when working with leaderboards, sets and lists
